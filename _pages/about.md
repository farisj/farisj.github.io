I'm a Software Engineer currently based in New York City.

I graduated in May 2015 with a degree in Computer Science from Connecticut College. After graduating, I attended The Flatiron School to fine-tune my understanding of web technology. Now, I'm working at a media company helping to maintain and publish video content on the web, using a combination of tools like Rails, React, Ember, and MongoDB.

In my spare time I like learning about new tech, making twitter bots ([check](https://www.twitter.com/everyorb) [them](https://www.twitter.com/bot_me_daddy) [out](https://www.twitter.com/queereveryword)!) and exploring everything that living in a huge city like NYC has to offer.
